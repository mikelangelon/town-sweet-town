Game build in Go using ebitenegine for game jam https://itch.io/jam/ebitengine-game-jam-2024, which had as theme "Building"

The game is about building a village and its community and trying to have a max Happiness status at the end of a 2 weeks period.
Some random rules appear every day which allows combine villages to improve the village stats.

I think the game is quite unfair and the rules system is a bit broken, maybe after the jam I would improve it. 
Because I liked a lot the idea and enjoyed building it.

And it allowed me to try new libraries!

# Libraries

github.com/solarlune/resolv: To detect collisions. But I didn't had the chance to use it properly
github.com/joelschutz/stagehand: To change scenes. I used quite a lot, even if maybe it was not needed for such tiny game
github.com/ebitenui/ebitenui: Pretty cool to use it, for the menu and HUIs.
github.com/icrowley/fake: To generate some random names and have even more randomness on the game.
